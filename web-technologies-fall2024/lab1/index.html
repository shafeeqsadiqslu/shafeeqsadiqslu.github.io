      used to play as Striker for my high school and college teams. I have
      played countless number of matches and have fond memories which stays
      close to my heart forever. My favourite team is FC Barcelona and my 3
      favourite players are listed below:

      I see myself as the best footballer in the world. If you don't believe you
      are the best, then you will never achieve all that you are capable of.
